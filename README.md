# ft_linear_regression

A fundamental Machine Learning project from the 42 curriculum that demonstrates how to implement simple linear regression with gradient descent.

---

## Project Objective

Build a predictive model to estimate car prices based on mileage using linear regression and gradient descent methods.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Linear Regression**: Predicting a dependent variable (price) from an independent variable (mileage).
- **Least Squares**: Analytical method to compute best-fit line parameters.
- **Gradient Descent**: Iterative optimization for finding parameter values that minimize the cost function.
- **Cost & Loss Functions**: Use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction error.
- **RÂ² Score**: Evaluation metric indicating how well the model explains variance.
- **Normalization Techniques**: Preprocessing (e.g., Min-Max scaling, Z-score standardization) to improve convergence and stability.
